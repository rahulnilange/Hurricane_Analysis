Hurricane Analysis
This CodeAcademy project organises and manipulates data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. The projected occured as this:

To begin, the damages list was updated to convert prefix values to floats and kept "Damages not Recorded".
With the new damages list and all other lists, a dictionary was constructed where the keys of the dictionary are the names of the hurricanes, and the values are dictionaries themselves containing a key for each piece of data (Name, Month, Year,Max Sustained Wind, Areas Affected, Damage, Death) about the hurricane.
Convert the current dictionary of hurricanes to a new dictionary, where the keys are years and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that occurred in that year.
Determine how often each area is listed as an affected area of a hurricane.
Find the area affected by most hurricanes, and how often hit.
Find the hurricane causing most deaths, and how many it caused.
Rate hurricanes on mortality scale according to the ratings provided, with key being rating and value being upper bound of deaths with that rating.
Find hurricane causing greatest damage, and how costly it was.
Rate hurricanes on damage scale according to the ratings provided, with key being rating and value being upper bound of damage for that rating.
